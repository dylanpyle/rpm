## Known limitations

- The "generate video" process is _slow_. It will hang the browser. This is
  mostly due to fetching the data buffers from the canvas. There are probably
  easy improvements here. Or â€” we could move it into a WebWorker.
- No audio support. This is [a
  limitation](https://github.com/TrevorSundberg/h264-mp4-encoder/issues/3) of
  the h264 encoder we're using. There are quite likely other good alternatives.
